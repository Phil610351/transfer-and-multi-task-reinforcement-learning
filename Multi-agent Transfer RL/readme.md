## Baselines

We have covered the implementation of these following multi-agent transfer RL methods, which are common used baselines presented in recent papers. 

This category include transfer among agents in the same-task and cross-task transfer works.

### Transfer among multiple agents:

- **DVM** - [IROS’2019](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/3306127.3331795)
- **MAPTF** - [NeurIPS’2021](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/hash/8d9a6e908ed2b731fb96151d9bb94d49-Abstract.html)


### Transfer across multi-agent tasks:


## Benchmarks

We run multi-task algorithm in the benchmarks: Multiagent Particle Environment (MPE), Pacman, and StarCraft II. Please follow the results below.

// some introduction to MPE.
